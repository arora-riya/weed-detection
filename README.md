## Weed-Detection

(This is a part of a team project under Design Practicum Course where we built a weed-detection and removal robot)
• We trained SSD Object Detection Model, for real-time detection of weeds through the camera on the robot’s robotic arm.
• The robot’s mobile base and robotic arm were programmed to move to the coordinates of detected weed using Raspberry Pi.
